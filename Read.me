This is a simple to use LTTO compatible Infra-red communications library, to work with LTTO/LTX/LTAR (Hasbro/Nerf) laser tag systems

It works with any Arduino Uno or Mega board.

I am a self taught programmer, who has been using Arduino's since early 2015.
I am still learning, but my code is now at the point that I am happy to share it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCHEMATIC

Connect an IR LED between Pin 13 and GND
Part # TSAL6200

Connect a 38kHz IR receiver as below
Part # TSOP4138
    - IR receiver Pin1 (Out) to Arduino Pin11
    - IR receiver Pin2 (Gnd) to Arduino GND
    - IR receiver Pin3 (Vcc) to Arduino +5v

    *
    * 3ms On, 6ms Off, 3ms (preamble) followed by 7 bits spaced apart by 2ms. One is represented by 2ms, zero is 1ms
    * In regular lazertag mode, the player and team bits are zero, but the last two bits signify how powerful the blast is.
    * for this example, we show a shot that does one damage and one that does 4 (max)

Another Bald person saved the day when I started to run out SRAM in my Uno and got the usual random lockups.
I was just about to upgrade to Mega boards when I found this blog on the F macro,
and 10 minutes later had recovered 40% of my SRAM and the project was back on track.


Ken Sherriff - for his ubiqitous IR library.
Although I no longer use it in the project, it taught me most of what I needed to know to create the current code.
I ditched the library for a number of reasons.
  1)  I needed to use different Pins for the IR_RECEIVE and IR_SEND, as the pins in the library were used for the LCD touch screen.
  2)  I really wanted duplex send/receive, whereas in Ken's library sending turns off receive.
      To me this is the MOST important aspect of a LaserTag system, it must be able to be shot whilst it is shooting.

Nick Gammon - In the last few months almost everytime I visited the Arduino.cc forum to ask a question, Nick had already posted an answer.
              After a while I started to read his blogs and other posts, and learn't a massive amount about the low level workings of the Arduino.
